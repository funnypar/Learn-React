In this repo i want to learn React from Jonas Schmedtmann's course 👑

1. In the first step, i must know about React and how it's works 🤔
   So i will handle pizza-menu project 🍕
   
2. In the second step, i want to create my very small profile-card Project 😍
   
                    So let's do it now 🤠
